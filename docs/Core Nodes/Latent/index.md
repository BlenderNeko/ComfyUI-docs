# Latent

Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion do not operate in pixel space, but denoise in latent space instead. These nodes provide ways to switch between pixel and latent space using [encoders](./VAEEncode.md) and [decoders](./VAEDecode.md), and provide a variety of ways to manipulate latent images.
